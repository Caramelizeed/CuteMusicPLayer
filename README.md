# Music Player Web Application

This is a simple web-based music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play audio files, view song titles, and control playback. The player features a vinyl record animation that spins while the music is playing, and it also includes custom controls for play/pause, volume, next, previous, and mute.

## Features
- **Custom Controls**: Play, Pause, Next, Previous, and Mute buttons.
- **Vinyl Animation**: The vinyl disc spins while the song is playing.
- **Audio Progress Bar**: Displays the current progress of the song.
- **Song Title Display**: Shows the current song title.
- **Mute Button**: Mute/unmute the audio.
- **Responsive Design**: The player is mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Background Image**: Customizable background image for the player.

## Requirements
No external dependencies are required. All features are built with native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
